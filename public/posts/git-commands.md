### What is git
- Git is a distributed version control system that tracks versions of files. It is often used to control source code by programmers who are developing software collaboratively.

### Setting up the local git
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@mail.com"
```

### Git Init:
```bash
git init
# or
git init --inital-branch <branch_name>
```

### Adding files to the staging area
```bash
git add .
#####
git add <file_name>
```

### Remove file from staging area (Undo It)
```bash
git rm --cached <file_name1> <file_name2>  #... other files
```

- To remove the .git folder
```bash
rm -rf .git
```

### Status of the current commit:

```bash
git status
```

> Git does not track empty folders, only if some files are present

- Verbose (detailed info)
```bash
git status -v # detailed
# or
git status -s # short
```

### Commit
```bash
git commit -m "<message>"
```
> Now git is tracking the files which are committed, means which were in staging area before commit command.

![Working](blog4/1.png)

#### Head:
-> Points to the latest commit on the branch
-> We can always change the position of the head.

<!-- <img width="2113" height="821" alt="2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a31405d-8371-4a8b-8e3f-248807d500bd" /> -->
![](blog4/2.png)


> If you had made changes in the ***tracked file*** only then you don't need to add first in *staging area*  by using `add` and `commit` separate commands.
```bash
git commit -a -m "<commit_message>"
```


#### Modifying the existing commit

--> If you have already last commit present and you want to make changes in file of that commit but not creating a new commit, (To modify a existing commit)
```bash
# add to staging area
git add <file_name>

#modify the existing commit
git commit --amend  # prompts to update the commit message
# or
git commit --amend --no-edit # uses the existing commit message but does the same work as above
```

- Adding a signature to the commit
```bash
git commit -s -m "<msg>"
```
- Results as:
```bash
git log
""
commit 2dafvrrd59e2251xzfaee473e38 (HEAD -> master)
Author: User <user@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Jul 19 20:34:47 2025 +0530

    <msg>

    Signed-off-by: Sadanand Miskin <user@gmail.com>
""
```


> Can you create an empty commit?
> -> Yes.

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "<message>"
```

> Why do you need a empty commit?

> If ever I want to test my CI pipeline over Jenkins etc. .Without creating a new commit or modifying one just creating an empty commit to trigger and test my CI pipeline.


### Git Log

- Get the list of commits
```bash
git log
```

- Get only number of commits
```bash
git log -n 2 # top 2 commmits
```

- Get short version of logs
```bash
git log --pretty=short
# or
# --pretty=full ,for full
# --pretty=online
```

- Other method to log (Not much needed)
```bash
git log --pretty=format:"%h %n %an %ae"
# hash , message , author-name (you can use any one also)
```

- To know what changes happened in each commit
```bash
git log -p
""

### Git reset

- `git reset` provides us options:
	- Unstage the file changes
	- Undo the commit
	- Discard/Delete the commit

> There are 3 methods in `get reset`:
- soft
- mixed
- hard


![](blog4/3.png)
- Suppose I have 3 commits with file changes and I want to change the recent commit

> *Soft*: When using `soft` the changes are moved back to staging area.
```bash
git reset --soft <C2_commit_id>
```

```bash
git diff --staged
""
diff --git a/a.txt b/a.txt
index ced8e84..1a51ebe 100644
--- a/a.txt
+++ b/a.txt
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 hello from
+you know what
""
```

> *Mixed*:  It will bring back to Non staging area.
```bash
git reset --mixed <c2_commit_id>
```

> Hard: The changes you made in C3 will be discarded and deleted and head points to C2
```bash
git reset --hard <c2_commit_id>
```

### Git Revert
- The difference in `git revert` and `git reset` is that:
	- `git reset`:  It modifies the current commit and there is no backup to a commit.
	- `git revert`:  If you want to undo any commit, then it creates a new commit object without modifying the current (Not loosing the data).

- with example:
![](blog4/4.png)

```bash
git revert c3
# creates a new commit object as c4
```

```bash
git checkout <commit_id>
# You can place head to any commit
```

> *Note*: `git reset` is a powerful command, when used may affect all who has the access to the branch as it modifies and undo the commit which leads to loosing of data. Hence `git revert` is used to create a backup of the data

> Use git revert if you want to keep your commit changes stagnant.

### Branches

> Branches are always associated with commit not when `git init`, default as master.

- Create a branch
```bash
git branch <new_branch>
```

> You can create a new branch from where the `head` is pointing in `master` branch

<!-- <img width="2663" height="2998" alt="5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a991ec4d-1ade-47a3-9702-7026075c9de2" /> -->
![](blog4/5.png)



- As you can see here the `new` branch is one commit behind the `master` branch or `master` is one commit ahead.
- where as `new2` branch is in sync with the `master`.

- Checking out to other branch
```bash
git checkout <new_branch_name>
```

or use:
```bash
git switch <branchname>
```

> Branches provides us isolation to work independently without worrying about affecting to the master branch.

> From which branch you created a new branch that branch will be taken as reference

<!-- <img width="2685" height="1939" alt="6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da610a07-e878-4680-a9de-e3ccc41a10f0" /> -->
![](blog4/6.png)

- Here `new_branch_2` is head but created from reference of `new_branch_1` and it is 2 commits ahead of master branch.

- Deleting a branch:
```bash
git branch -d <branch_name>
```

##### Merging a branch:
```bash
git checkout master
```
`
```bash
git merge new_branch_2
```

- Now both master and new_branch_2 are in sync.

![](blog4/7.png)


- To merge any branch to the master branch, first we need to be in master branch
```bash
git switch master
```

- Then use merge command, Whatever the commit is in the Feature branch that will be added to master branch
```bash
git merge Feature
```

#### Git Merging Scenario - 2
<!-- <img width="4720" height="3752" alt="8" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b906433-5389-40de-a2fe-796da89f03e5" /> -->

• **Initial Setup**: Start with main branch at commit C1, then C2 becomes the HEAD

• **Feature Branch Creation**:
  - `git branch feature1` creates a new branch from C2
  - `git branch feature2` creates another branch from C2

• **Independent Development**:
  - Feature1 branch: Add commit CF1 with message "in f1"
  - Feature2 branch: Add commit CF2 with message "in f2"

• **Merging Process**:
  - **Step 1**: `git merge feature1` - Merges feature1 into main, HEAD moves to CF1
  - **Step 2**: HEAD moves to feature2 branch at CF2
  - **Step 3**: `git merge feature2` - Creates a new merge commit CF12 combining both features

• **Final State**:
  - All features are integrated into main branch
  - CF12 represents the merged state containing changes from both feature branches
  - New updates can be added to the dashed box for future development

>This demonstrates a typical feature branch workflow where multiple developers work on separate features before merging them back into the main branch.


### Git conflicts
<!-- <img width="5614" height="3018" alt="9" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25d2152d-264b-4a21-8c86-28e4d5335016" /> -->
![](blog4/9.png)

• **Same Starting Point**: Both feature1 and feature2 branches created from commit C2

• **Conflicting Changes**:
- Feature1 modifies `file.txt` line 5: `"Hello World"`
- Feature2 modifies `file.txt` line 5: `"Hi Universe"`
- Both branches change the **same line** in the **same file**

• **First Merge Success**: `git merge feature1` works fine - no conflict yet

• **Second Merge Conflict**: `git merge feature2` fails because:
- Git can't decide which version to keep
- Same line has different content from two sources

• **Conflict Markers**: Git adds conflict markers to the file:
- `<<<<<<< HEAD` - Current branch content
- `=======` - Separator
- `>>>>>>> feature2` - Incoming branch content

• **Resolution Process**:
- **Edit** the file manually to choose/combine changes
- **Remove** conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
- **Stage** the resolved file: `git add file.txt`
- **Commit** the resolution: `git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"`

• **Final Result**: Creates merge commit (CM) that successfully combines both branches with resolved conflicts

> Conflicts occur when the same lines in the same files are modified differently in both branches being merged.


### Git cherry-pick
Apart from using `git merge` we have another method to merge the other branches with `master`.

- check out to master branch:
```bash
git checkout master
```

- cherry-pick the commit id of a feature branch
```bash
git cherry-pick <any_feature_branch_commit_id_tobe_merged>
```
> Thus a new commit object is created in master branch from feature branch


#### Difference in cherry-pick and merge:
- If suppose you are working on `feature` branch and you did `4` commits, but 3 commits are ready and the 4th one is not.
- For a feature in your application, So you want to include the commit from 3rd commit into your `master` branch, you can use `cherry-pick` and use 3rd commit Id from feature branch and use it in master.
- But if you use `git merge` it will merge all the commits, simply the recent commit from `feature` branch into `master`.
- But in this case the 4th commit from the feature branch is not ready to be used in master.
- Hence we need to use `git cherry-pick`, Which we can use any commit id to be used in master.
> Cherry-Picking is like to pick any commit from a branch and merge it with master. But 'Merging' is like taking all the commits from a branch and merging it with master where master has history to all the commits linked from that branch, but cherry-pick doesn't.

> Best use of cherry-pick is when we have a feature commit ready and other is not, but it is required for updation.

### Connecting Local Repo to Remote Repo

- Remote Repositories:
	- GitHub
	- GitLab
	- BitBucket

> In a new project folder

- Adding a connection with remote repo
```bash
git remote add origin <url>
```

- After that, init-add-commit in your master branch, then push it to remote repo
```bash
git push -u origin <branch>
```
> After pushing you have a remote tracking branch created which tracks the remote repo and its contents - goes by `origin/<branch>`

#### Revisiting git log
- This command just refers to the local
```bash
git branch
```

- For remote branches
```bash
git branch -r
```

### Git Cloning
- Cloning a remote repository
```bash
git clone <repo_url.git>
```

- Get verbose about the remote
```bash
git remote -v
```

### Git Fetch and Pull

- Lets say your project has `master` which is local branch and `origin/master` which is remote tracking branch after you pushed into remote repo.

#### Fetch
- It is used to download the changes from remote repository to your local repository
```bash
git fetch
#or
git fetch origin
```

> *Note*: It will update only the remote tracking branches i.e `origin/master` but not added to `master`

For syncing the changes in master branch we do,
```bash
git checkout master
# then
git merge origin/master
```

- To fetch changes of a certain branch which needed
```bash
git fetch origin <branch_name>
```

- If a project has multiple remote repositories like github, gitlab etc and to get all the changes of these in my local repo
```bash
git fetch --all
```

- Whichever remote tracking branches are deleted, it will remove from local also
```bash
git fetch --prune
```

#### Pull
 - `git pull` is nothing but the combination of 2 commands
	 - `git fetch`
	 - `git merge`

```bash
git pull
```

>*Note*: Use git pull only to the protected branches like 'master' , 'main'

> You can pull from any remote branch to any local branch just by using
```bash
git checkout <local_branch>
# and
git pull origin <remote_branch>
```

#### using rebase (optional)
- For a cleaner branch history

> git pull:
```bash
Before:
A---B---C (remote has commit C)
     \
      D (your local commit with new file)

After:
A---B---C (origin/main)
     \   \
      D---M (your main, M is merge commit)


>$ git pull --rebase

Before:
A---B---C (remote)
     \
      D (your local commit)

After:
A---B---C---D' (linear history, your commit moved on top)
```
### Git Stash

If you have a file in a branch which is already been tracked by git and later you have modified the file and its in staging area, Later you want to move to another branch without committing the changes, then git throws an error like `commit or stash the file as it will be overwritten`.
Hence we use `git stash` to keep store of  temporary changes in a space  until commit.

- Use git stash when:
	- when have modified changes and don't want to commit
	- moving to other branch with those modified changes

```bash
git stash list
# stash@{0}: WIP on master: 75b3f1d ok
```

- Returning back and want to apply those changes
```bash
git stash apply <stash_id> # stash@{0}
```

- Clear stash list
```bash
git stash clear
```

### .gitignore

Certain files and folders need not to be tracked, like `node_modules` `.env`
